 ## 📊 Sales Data Analysis Project

This project is a data analysis notebook focused on extracting insights from a sales dataset using Python and data science libraries such as **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **SciPy**.

### 🔍 What This Project Does

The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a CSV file containing sales data. Key analysis includes:

* 📈 **Overall revenue computation**
* 📆 **Yearly and monthly sales performance**
* 👥 **Customer age distribution**
* 🛍️ **Top-selling product categories**
* 💰 **Average unit cost and unit price per category**
* 📊 **Total cost and revenue by product category**
* ⚠️ **Outlier detection** in quantity and unit price using z-score
* 🔢 **Most common product sub-category**
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Revenue distribution by customer gender**
* 🌎 **Highest revenue-generating states**
* 📦 **Average quantity sold per sub-category**

### 📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on a CSV file named `sales_data.csv`. This file should contain fields such as:

* `Revenue`
* `Year`
* `Month`
* `Quantity`
* `Customer Age`
* `Product Category`
* `Unit Cost`
* `Unit Price`
* `Sub Category`
* `Customer Gender`
* `State`
